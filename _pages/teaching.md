#### Tutorials on causal inference and machine learning

**[Beginner]**
<br />
If you are new to causal inference, try this tutorial first.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸ“–A breezy introduction to causal inference, involving fire, Hooke's law and R. A. Fisher.
[[IC2S2](https://www.github.com/amit-sharma/causal-inference-tutorial/)] [[Video](https://youtu.be/6SCoaBo1MqU?si=qg2Feu-kOYHsM4ts)]

**[Effect inference]**
<br />
If you are interested in effect inference and want to understand which method is suitable for your problem, this tutorial is a timeless one (except the early description of DoWhy!).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸ“–Part I: Learn about the two main frameworks (Causal Graphical Models and Potential Outcomes) and how they can be used together.
[[KDD 2018: Intro](https://causalinference.gitlab.io/kdd-tutorial/intro.html)]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸ“–Part II: Learn about the two main methods (conditioning-based and natural experiments) and when to use which.
[[KDD 2018: Methods](https://causalinference.gitlab.io/kdd-tutorial/methods.html)]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸ“–Part III: Case studies on causal inference with large-scale data
[[KDD 2018: Large Scale Data](https://causalinference.gitlab.io/kdd-tutorial/largescale-data.html)]

**[For practitioners]**
<br />
If you are a practitioner and interested in applying causal inference to your problem, I recommend this webinar.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸ“–Learn about the four steps of causal inference (Model, Identify, Estimate, Refute) and how to apply them using DoWhy/PyWhy.
[[MSR Webinar 2020](https://causalinference.gitlab.io/kdd-tutorial/largescale-data.html)] [[Video](https://youtu.be/LALfQStONEc?si=bjqBcAAq6278rTgR)]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸ’»Hands-on tutorial on causal inference and its connections to ML using DoWhy and EconML libraries.
[[PyWhy](https://www.pywhy.org/dowhy/v0.12/example_notebooks/tutorial-causalinference-machinelearning-using-dowhy-econml.html)]

**[Causality for ML]**
<br />
If you are interested in how causality can improve robustness or generalization of machine learning, this tutorial explains what is possible.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸ“–Part I: When can causality help ML models generalize better, and when is it less useful. How to build trustworthy and causal ML systems?
[[MLRS 2023: Intro](/assets/tutorials/MLRS-PartI-Causal-Machine-Learning-intro.pdf)]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸ“–Part II: Learn about how large language models may address the biggest impediment to scaling causal ML: building a causal graph.
[[MLRS 2023: LLMs](/assets/tutorials/MLRS-PartII-Causal-Machine-Learning-Practice-LLMs.pdf)]
