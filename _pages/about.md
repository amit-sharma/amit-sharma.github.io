Data tells stories. My research aims to tell the _causal_ story.

As machine learning systems move into societally critical domains such as healthcare, education, finance and criminal justice, questions on their impact gain fundamental importance.
The key insight in my work is to consider modern algorithms as _interventions_, just like a medical treatment or an economic policy. Unlike typical interventions studied in social and biomedical sciences, however, algorithmic interventions can be arbitrarily complex. I work on developing methods to estimate causal impact of such systems and build algorithms that optimize the causal effect. I am also passionate about designing new interventions for societal impact, especially in healthcare.

If you are interested in working with me at MSR India, drop me an email. We hire interns throughout the year. There are also [postdoctoral positions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/msr-india-hiring/) available. Additionally,
if you are an undergraduate or a masters student, <!--you can additionally apply to the pre-doctoral [Research Fellowship](link-to-rf) program.-->
our lab runs an excellent pre-doctoral [Research Fellowship](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/research-fellow-program/)
program.
