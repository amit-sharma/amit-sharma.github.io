I'm a machine learning researcher focused on improving the reasoning abilities of AI systems.

My work combines two seemingly incompatible ideas: the messy but generalizable capabilities of language models with the principled but rigid capabilities of causal reasoning. Early in 2023, I saw the potential of large language models (LLMs) for inferring causal relationships, a key part of scientific discovery. This has led to LLM-based algorithms that achieve up to [96% accuracy on inferring cause and effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00050) across scientific fields, including medicine (Covid-19), climate science (Arctic sea ice coverage), and engineering. This work has now expanded into the [PyWhy-LLM project](https://github.com/py-why/pywhyllm), an open-source tool for building a causal AI assistant for science.

On the other end, I work on how causality can help improve AI model reliability. My research has led to open-source software such as [DoWhy](https://github.com/py-why/dowhy) for causal reasoning and [DiCE](https://github.com/interpretml/DiCE/) for counterfactual explanation that are used by millions globally. These days, I'm most excited by [Axiomatic Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07612), a framework for building reasoning verifiers that can correct a language model's output in real-time. This approach has shown that even a small 8B-parameter model can achieve nearly double the accuracy of frontier LLMs on causal reasoning tasks.

I'm also passionate about designing technology interventions that can have a positive societal impact (e.g., see [MindNotes app](https://mindnotes.nimhans.ac.in/)).
If you are interested in working with me at MSR India, drop me an email. We hire interns throughout the year. There are also [postdoctoral positions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/msr-india-hiring/) available. Additionally,
if you are an undergraduate or a masters student, <!--you can additionally apply to the pre-doctoral [Research Fellowship](link-to-rf) program.-->
our lab runs an excellent pre-doctoral [Research Fellows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/research-fellows-program-at-microsoft-research-india/) program.
