Advancing AI reasoning.

I study how causality and other formal reasoning systems can improve AI reasoning. See [PlanX-RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20753) for an example on how solving complex tasks can be abstracted out as planning over a directed acyclic graph (DAG), wherein each node of the DAG can be a LLM inference call.
