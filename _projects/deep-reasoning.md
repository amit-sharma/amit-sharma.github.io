I study how causality and other formal reasoning systems can improve AI reasoning and help solve complex problems that require exploration over thousands of steps. See [Plan\*RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20753) for an example on how solving complex tasks can be abstracted out as planning over a directed acyclic graph.
