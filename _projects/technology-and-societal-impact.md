I am passionate about using technology for greater social good. As one focus, I have worked on improving mental health outreach through technology. Check out the [MindNotes](https://mindnotes.nimhans.ac.in/) app for mental health, built in collaboration with NIMHANS hospital.

I also work on how machine learning systems can be used to optimize the reach or impact of societal interventions.
