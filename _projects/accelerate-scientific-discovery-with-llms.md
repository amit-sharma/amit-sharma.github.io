title: Accelerate scientific discovery
description: "[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00050'>Causal Frontiers</a>, <a href='https://github.com/py-why/pywhyllm'>PyWhy-LLM</a>] In late 2022, I stumbled upon an interesting discovery: LLMs are really good at inferring causal relationships from scientific literature and in some cases, can even suggest missing relationships or confounders for a study. I am now working to see how such AI capabilities can used to accelerate the scientific process. How can we discover promising hypotheses faster and how can we verify their validity?"

In late 2022, I stumbled upon [an interesting discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00050): LLMs are really good at inferring causal relationships from scientific literature and in some cases, can even suggest missing relationships or confounders for a study {% cite kiciman2024-frontiers %}. I am now working to see how such AI capabilities can used to accelerate the scientific process.

#### Relevant work

1. Algorithms that can infer causal relationships using both existing knowledge and data {% cite vashishtha2025causal %}
2. Discover promising hypotheses faster and verify their validity

All code for the project is available at [PyWhy-LLM](https://github.com/py-why/pywhyllm).
