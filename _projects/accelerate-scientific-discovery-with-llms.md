title: Accelerate scientific discovery
description: "[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00050'>Causal Frontiers</a>] In late 2022, I stumbled upon an interesting discovery: LLMs are really good at inferring causal relationships from scientific literature and in some cases, can even suggest missing relationships or confounders in a study. I am now working to see how such AI capabilities can used to accelerate the scientific process. How can we discover promising hypotheses faster and how can we verify their validity?"

In late 2022, I stumbled upon [an interesting discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00050): LLMs are really good at inferring causal relationships from scientific literature and in some cases, can even suggest missing relationships or confounders in a study. I am now working to see how such AI capabilities can used to accelerate the scientific process. How can we discover promising hypotheses faster and how can we verify their validity?
