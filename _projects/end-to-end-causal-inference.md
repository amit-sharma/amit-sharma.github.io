title: End-to-end causal inference
description: "[<a href='#'>DoWhy</a>, <a href='#'>PyWhy</a>] Unlike prediction, causal inference depends critically on assumptions: no causes in, no causes out. DoWhy, an open-source Python library that I built, provides an API interface to formally state and verify assumptions. I now work on better methods to verify assumptions of any causal analysis."
