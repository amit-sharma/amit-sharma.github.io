Unlike prediction, causal inference depends critically on assumptions: "no causes in, no causes out". To help researchers formally state and verify causal assumptions, I built DoWhy {% cite sharma2020dowhy %}, an open-source Python library that is widely used across industry and academia. I now work on methods to improve the state-of-the-art for root-cause analysis and robustness tests in causal inference.
